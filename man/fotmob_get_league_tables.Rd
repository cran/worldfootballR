\title{Get standings from fotmob}
\usage{
fotmob_get_league_tables(country, league_name, league_id, cached = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{Three character country code. Can be one or multiple. If provided, `league_name` must also be provided (of the same length)}

\item{league_name}{League names. If provided, `country` must also be provided (of the same length)}

\item{league_id}{Fotmob ID for the league. Only used if `country` and `league_name` are not specified.}

\item{cached}{Whether to load the dataframe from the \href{https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data/blob/master/raw-data/fotmob-leagues/all_leagues.csv}{data CSV}. This is faster and most likely what you want to do, unless you identify a league that's being tracked by fotmob that's not in this pre-saved CSV.}
